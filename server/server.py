#                   information on supported commands, command format, etc.
#                   - Listens for connections on PORT specified in input arguments
#                   - Accepts a client connection
#                   - While client connected, respond to requests
#                   - Debug flag '-d' can be passed to script to enable verbose
#                     printing of messages sent/received
